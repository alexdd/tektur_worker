# tektur_worker

Camunda external task executor written in Python that compiles a few scripts that I've been using in different projects. 

Since it can transform, validate and store XML files in XML databases (exist-db) or AWS S3 it may be used for your custom ETL processes. Have fun!

WORK-IN-PROGRESS!
